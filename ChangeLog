2018-12-20  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.3.1

	* update of fminsdp and changes resulting from it. Examples tested
	with Matlab 2018b.

2016-08-04  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.3.0

	* new option NLPsolver makes possible to incorporate different NLP
	solvers. Tested with Ipopt. 

2015-06-22  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.2.0

	* initoptimvar.m, liniconstr.m, testinputvar.m: input and state
	constraints can be defined individually on each interval. Thanks
	to Ayush Sharma <ayush.sharma@stuba.sk>

2014-07-29  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.5

	* initoptimvar.m: fixed warning "Your initial point x0 is not
	between bounds lb and ub". Thanks to Hua Zhengui <zhengui.hua@entpe.fr>  

2014-02-13  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* typo fix in documentation of Exaple 3.1.6 (car problem):
	incorrect state description. Thanks to Stephen Phillips
	(stephen.phillips@colorado.edu)

2014-01-07  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* examples tested with matlab 2013b. 

2012-11-27  Martin Jelemensky  <martin.jelemensky@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.4

	* liniconstr.m: bug if only one time interval was optimised

2012-06-21  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* added examples car, car2: minimum time problem without (car) and
	with path constraints (car2)

2010-04-02  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> 

	* added problem9 - optimal diafiltration

	* examples tested with matlab 2010a and its new solver sqp. In
	majority of cases, better results have been obtained, or fewer NLP
	iterations.

2009-04-13  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk>

	* dynoptim/profiles.m: typos in comments

2009-02-24  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.3

	* problem3 did not print graph with constraint. main program was
	old. now ok.

	* problem7 was not working due to old syntax of process and
	objfun. now ok.

	* examples tested with matlab 2008b, all work, but with slight
	optimum changes (as with any different versions of matlab,
	fmincon, etc). Only problem1b is still with Matlab 2007a, did not
	converge under 2008. Older versions of matlab might have problem
	with line in the main program:
	options = optimset(options,'Algorithm','active-set');
	It can be commented if necessary. 

	* Users's guide - corrected several typos, all results calculated
	with matlab 2008b (except problem1b).

2008-10-24  Miroslav Fikar  <miroslav.fikar@stuba.sk> Version 4.1.2

	* No code changes. Repackaged, all dynopt functions now reside in
	a single directory dynoptim and not in further subdirectories. All
	other directories should be outside this tree so that the files
	and functions therein cannot interfere with others. Thanks to
	B. Roffel (NL) for spotting it.

	* Begin of a new ChangeLog
